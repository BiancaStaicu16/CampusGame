## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

First set up your python virtual environment.

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Then activate it with:

```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat      # Windows
.venv\bin\activate              # Linux
source <venv> bin/activate      # MacOS
```

Install python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements-base.txt
```

Do your migrations (create your development database):
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the django server using:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

### Next install the VueJS frontend dependencies:

```
cd frontend
npm install
```
**NOTE:** When you pull changes that others have made, you may want to do 
`npm install` again to ensure any additional dependencies have been added.

Next, install the Google Maps API Dependency 
```
npm install --save vue-geolocation-api
```

Next, install the QR Code Dependency 
```
npm install --save vue-qrcode-reader
```

Now to build the frontend, there are two ways:

Watches for any changes in the filetree and recompiles when detects a change:
```
npm run watch
npm run serve
```

Compiles and minifies for production:
```
npm run build
```

### Need some test data?

Run the bootstrap to autogenerate some dummy data using:
```
python manage.py bootstrap
```
**NOTE:** Do this after migrating for the first time.

### Having a migration error?

This may be due to a database update. Simply drop you current database and create a new one as follows:
1. Delete `db.sqlite3` file
2. Run `python manage.py migrate`
